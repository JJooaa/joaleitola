### Finance / Banking Integration

I worked on a finance management system that integrated a banking API into a property management platform. This enabled property managers to monitor payment histories and balances, improving financial management.

For the user interface, I focused on making it intuitive and user-friendly. I tested the system for bugs, optimized its performance, and ensured its stability.

I used technologies like Hasura and Nhost for the backend architecture. These managed data efficiently, handled user authentication and authorization, and ensured system security. The result was a finance management system that empowered property managers.

### Other Features

I also added advanced features to the platform, including a comprehensive maintenance, modifications, and repair planning system. These features were developed with technologies like React.js, Hasura, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, MaterialUI, and Vite.

These features allowed property managers to efficiently plan and execute property maintenance and improvements. They could schedule tasks, track modifications, and address repairs promptly.

By integrating these features, we made the platform a comprehensive solution for property management professionals. The use of modern technologies ensured feature-rich performance and enhanced user experience for property managers.
