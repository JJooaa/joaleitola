</div>

I played a significant role in developing a service information system that revolutionized how social welfare clients access service providers. I closely collaborated with our development team to address technical issues and implement crucial enhancements.

Our objective was to improve an existing system, making it more efficient and user-friendly for both social welfare clients and service providers. We worked together on continuous development, focusing on optimizing various components such as search algorithms, database management, and user interface design.

Our combined efforts aimed to refine and streamline the process of connecting clients with service providers, ultimately enhancing the system's overall performance and accessibility within the welfare sector.

As a result of our collective endeavors, we successfully bridged the gap between those in need and the essential services they require, ultimately making a significant impact in the welfare sector.
