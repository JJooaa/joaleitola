When embarking on the journey to build my personal website, I was focused to make it stand out in a crowded online world. I wanted a website that not only looked good but also performed exceptionally well, with a focus on SEO and simplicity.

As a tech professional, I know the importance of a well-made website. It reflects expertise and attention to detail. This personal website is more than a digital calling card; it's a dynamic sales pitch showcasing my skills in web development, SEO, and user experience design.

In web development, the choice of rendering methods greatly impacts the user experience and a website's success. For my personal website, I chose server rendering which includes static rendering and dynamic rendering. Here are some of the benefits of server rendering:

- **Faster Page Loading Times:** Server rendering can improve the browser's rendering speed through various optimizations, including caching, resulting in a better user experience.

- **Improved SEO:** Server rendering makes it easier for search engines to crawl and index the page, resulting in higher search rankings.

- **Enhanced User Experience:** Server rendering ensures optimized initial page load, providing a smoother and more responsive interface.

- **Improved Performance on Low-End Devices:** Server rendering is ideal for users on low-end devices or slow internet connections, reaching a wider audience with less client-side processing.

- **Seamless Sharing on Social Media:** Server-rendered content enhances sharing on social media platforms. Customizable shared links with metadata and rich previews make the content more attractive and engaging to potential visitors.
