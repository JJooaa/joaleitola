# Automotive Industry

<p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">June 2022 - Current</p>

In the automotive industry, I have been leading a project to enhance the client's application. Throughout this journey, I have closely collaborated with the client to understand their unique needs and align the platform with their vision.

One notable achievement of this project was the implementation of a new search engine. The previous search engine was cumbersome, and the client urgently required improved search capabilities. In the automotive landscape, efficiency is crucial, and users must be able to effortlessly find the exact information they are looking for.

To revolutionize the user experience, we conducted a comprehensive overhaul of the entire website. Modern tools like Next.js and ChakraUI were utilized to revamp the user interface.

The integration of external APIs played a vital role in this project. These APIs enabled the platform to access additional data, such as real-time tax prices and a vast database of cars. The amount of data being processed is substantial, and the application is used by hundreds of users on a daily basis.
