# Automotive Industry

<p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">June 2022 - Current</p>

<div className="rounded-md border border-l-4 border-l-orange-400 p-4 font-semibold">
  I don't have the legal rights to display the actual application that I have
  worked on. Due to this I can only provide a brief description of the project.
</div>

In the automotive industry, I have been the driving force behind a transformative project, overseeing the client's application. This journey has been marked by close collaboration with the client, where we delved into their unique needs and aligned the platform with their vision.

One of the highlights of this project was the implementation of a new search engine. The previous search engine was clumsy, and the client was in dire need of supercharging the search capabilities. In the automotive landscape, efficiency is paramount, and users must effortlessly locate the exact information they seek.

To revolutionize the user experience, the entire website underwent a comprehensive makeover. Modern tools like Next.js and ChakraUI were used in revamping the user interface.

The integration of external APIs played a crucial role in this project. These APIs empowered the platform to access additional data, such as real-time tax prices and hundreds of thousands cars. The amount of data that is being processed is huge and the application is being used by hundreds of users every day.
