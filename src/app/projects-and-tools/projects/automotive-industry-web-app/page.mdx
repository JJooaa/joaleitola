In this project, I've been the go-to person for managing the client's application and handling all the code-related stuff. I've had the pleasure of working closely with the client, discussing their needs and making sure the platform aligns with what they're looking for.

One of the cool things I did was supercharging the search features so that users can easily hunt down exactly what they're looking for. I also gave the whole website a makeover, using modern tools like Next.js and ChakraUI to revamp the user interface and make it look and feel awesome.

But it's not just about looks - I've been diving into the backend too. I've been coding away with Nest.js, Docker, and Google Cloud to keep the platform running smoothly and efficiently.

I've been playing around with external APIs to grab extra data like tax prices and made sure everything flows seamlessly. Used Paytrail to bring in a payment system, so users can buy stuff with confidence right within the platform. It's been a fun ride, making things work and look great!
