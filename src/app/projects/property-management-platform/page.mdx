### Finance / Banking Integration

I was responsible for the creation of a finance management system that seamlessly incorporated a banking API into an property management platform. This integration empowered property managers with essential tools to monitor payment histories and keep tabs on balances, greatly enhancing the financial management of properties.

During this project, I dedicated my efforts to developing an intuitive and user-friendly user interface. This entailed a process of testing the system for bugs and errors, ensuring its stability and reliability, and optimizing it for optimal performance and scalability.

For the backend architecture, I utilized technologies such as Hasura and Nhost. These were pivotal in managing data efficiently and handling user authentication and authorization, ensuring the system's security and functionality. The end result was a finance management system that elevated the property management platform and empowered property managers to make informed financial decisions.

### Other Features

In addition to the financial components, I also took the initiative to introduce several advanced features to the platform. Notable among these was the implementation of a comprehensive maintenance, modifications, and repair planning system. These additional functionalities were developed using an array of sophisticated technologies, including React.js, Hasura, GraphQL, PostgreSQL MaterialUI, and Vite.

The maintenance, modifications, and repair planning system went beyond just financial management. It offered property managers a robust toolset to efficiently plan and execute property maintenance and improvements. This included scheduling and monitoring maintenance tasks, tracking property modifications, and swiftly addressing necessary repairs.

By seamlessly integrating these features into the platform, we elevated its utility and versatility, making it a comprehensive solution for property management professionals. The use of technologies like React.js, Hasura, GraphQL, MaterialUI, and Vite ensured that these features were not only feature-rich but also delivered exceptional performance and responsiveness, significantly enhancing the user experience and productivity of property managers.
